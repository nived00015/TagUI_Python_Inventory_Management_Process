# TagUI_Python_Inventory_Management_Process
This is a Inventory Management process which is executed by tagui for python. Here in addition i had used the visual automation tricks so that it feels like same as human is doing the things manually [ as there are some exceptions around to it]
This process is executed as follows:

1. First there are three folders, insert,update, delete, which will contains the pdf files which contains data for inserting,updating and deleting the records in Inventory Management Portal respectively.
2. The bot opens the website https://excelcult.com/inventorymanagement/
3. Then the bot takes the data from each pdf file under Insert folder and add the record from data from each pdf in the portal.
4. Then the bot takes the data from each pdf file under update folder and update the price of existing records.
5.Then the bot takes the data from each pdf file under delete folder and delete the existing record.

The speciality of this process is i had applied the visual automation tricks so that the automation will be feeling almost simmilar how the manual process is done. Like as u see how the pdf file is opened and readed.
